# Data Structures - Linked List

## What we learn

- working with unit tests
- we discuss what is a linked list and types of linked list
- we implement a linked list and its methods
- we will show a practical example - implementing a linked list to store the moves in a game of chess.

## Methods of linked list

We will implement operations to:

- getAt(index) - get the element at some index
- insertAt(index, data) - insert a new element at specified index with specified data
- getLast() - get the last element in the linked list
- removeAt(index) - remove an element at specified index
- forEach(predicateFn) - iterate all elements and execute a predicate function for every element

These methods are common for linked lists but many others can be created based on needs, such as e.g.:

- firstMatch(data) - find first element in the list where data matches argument
