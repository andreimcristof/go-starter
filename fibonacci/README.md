# Fibonacci sequence

Fibonacci is a sequence of numbers starting with 0 and 1, where each number is the sum of the previous two.

We want to call a function where we pass an integer N and we get the number in the fibonacci sequence at the demanded position

```go
fibonacci(6) // should output 8 ( 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8)
```
